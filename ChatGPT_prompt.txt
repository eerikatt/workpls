I will be paste a Java program that includes 5 files, App.java,
Inventory.java, Pricing.java, Sales.java and SalesCounter.java. 

Do not comment on the code in the files.  Wait for further instructions.

After I paste the java files, I will then paste a transcript of a Zoom session that contains an explanation of what the program is doing.

Do not comment on the explanation until I tell you to begin.

The following are the instructions you will use to study the java files and critique the explanaion:  

Critique the explanation using the following guidelines: 

1) Each file must be discussed starting with App.java.  The proper order of explanation is left for you to decide.
2) The explanation must discuss the purpose and use of private fields or methods, static fields, static methods and imports. 

3) The explanation must discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages of placing Inventory.java, Pricing.java in separate directories and Sales.java and SalesCounter.java together in a separate directory. 

4) The explanation should have two recommendations for improving the code

5) Your critique will be dividied into what was good, what could be improved and what was missing in the explanation.

6) After you critique the explanation, critique it a second time as if the
person is explaining code to an interviewer from Apple who is recruiting for an entry level Java programming position.

Do not begin until after I paste the code and the transcript of the explanation.
